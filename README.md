# üéôÔ∏è Voice Notes Summarizer

Voice Notes Summarizer converts audio files into full transcriptions and AI-generated summaries. Summaries can be generated in Short, Medium, or Detailed lengths. Both the transcript and summary can be downloaded as text files. All processing is performed on the device, ensuring audio privacy without requiring API keys or external servers.

## How It Works

Step-by-step process:

1. **Upload Audio:** Select a file in MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, or OGG format.  
2. **Transcription:** Convert audio to text using OpenAI Whisper.  
3. **Generate Summary:** Choose a summary length and generate a concise AI-powered summary with HuggingFace BART.  
4. **Download Results:** Save both the transcript and the summary as text files.  
5. **Reset (Optional):** Clear all results and start over.
